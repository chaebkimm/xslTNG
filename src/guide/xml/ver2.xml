  <title>Changes in version 2.0</title>
</info>

<para>Version 2.x of the <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG
Stylesheets</citetitle> include some substantial changes from version
1.x. If you use the stylesheets “out of the box” without any
customization, you should have no trouble updating from version 1.x to
version 2.1.0 (or later), but there will be differences in the HTML
produced. If you have customization layers for 1.x, you may need to
change them in order to get the results you expect from 2.x.</para>

<para>The most significant rewrite, and the change that actually
motivated the decision to adopt some backwards incompatible changes,
is in the area of localization. Version 1.x of the
<citetitle>xslTNG</citetitle> stylesheets attempted to simplify (from
the preceding XSLT 2.0 stylesheets) how generated text was
constructed. The model adopted simply didn’t work for some languages.
Trying to adapt the model to support these languages was going to
result in something <emphasis>even more complicated</emphasis> than
what had worked before, so the model has largely been reverted to what
it was before.</para>

<para>The format of the localization data and the way that it’s used
are the subject of <xref linkend="gentext"/>. In broad terms, the new
system should produce “the same results” as the old system for an
equivalent localization, but there may be small changes in the way
lists of titles and cross references are formatted.</para>

<note>
<para>This chapter is still being revised. This is (mostly) a placeholder.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Implemented an
<link linkend="onpage-toc">on-page table of contents</link> feature.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Switched to
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">section</tag> elements for
sections inside a <tag>refentry</tag> instead of
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">div</tag> elements.
This supports the new 
<link linkend="onpage-toc">on-page table of contents</link> feature and
should have been done when the rest of the sectioning elements
were converted.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Moved the 
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">footer</tag> element from
just after
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">main</tag> to just inside it.
This simplifies and improves CSS rendering and is arguably more correct.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Made including the <filename>docbook-print.css</filename> file conditional
on producing print output. Modern browsers attempt to parse the file, even when
the link specifies that it’s for print media, and produce a large number of
spurious error messages.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Fixed a bug where the <filename>catalog.xml</filename> file in the
jar file was not at a location where the XML Resolver would find it.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Reworked ToC handling. Added <parameter>auto-toc</parameter> parameter.
The placement of generated lists-of-titles can now be controlled with an
empty <tag>toc</tag> element (or <tag class="pi">db-toc</tag> processing
instruction).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Support creation of ToCs generated by hand. (Former handling for
<tag>tocdiv</tag> and <tag>tocentry</tag> was just broken.)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Deprecated the <mode>m:html-body-script</mode> mode.
Changed the way the standard scripts are included; instead of putting them
at the end of the 
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">body</tag> element, they’re
placed in the 
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">head</tag> but explicitly marked
deferred.
</para>
</listitem> 
<listitem>
<para>Fixed incorrect URIs for SVG draft overlay in print CSS.</para>
</listitem> 
<listitem>
<para>Completely refactored the way that media objects are located
during the transformation and how the URIs for them are generated in
the output. It is now possible to store the media objects in a location
independent of the source files. Four separate source arrangements are represented
in the test suite and each can be processed to produce several different outputs;
see the <code>mediaobject-test</code> group of tasks. (Run
<command>./gradlew tasks</command> in the source repository.)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Fixed the bug where attributes on image, video, audio, and text objects
in <tag>mediaobject</tag> and <tag>inlinemediaobject</tag> were not being preserved
in the output. In particular, this meant that <tag class="attribute">role</tag>
attributes on those objects were not reflected in the HTML
<tag class="attribute">class</tag> attribute.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Changed <code>ext:cwd()</code> so that it always returns an absolute URI.
This fixes a bug in chunk output base URI handling. Tidied up some code.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Removed <keycap>↑</keycap> from <parameter>chunk-nav</parameter>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Support media objects that have no media (e.g., a media object that contains
only inline text objects).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Process unexected elements in titlepage templates in the normal way; removed
the warning message associated with them. Add it back by putting
<code>templates</code> in <parameter>debug</parameter>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Improved presentation of multiple <tag>keycap</tag> elements in a 
<tag>keycombo</tag>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Added table-of-contents to the linear flow of EPUBs. This fixes an
<application>epubcheck</application> 3.3 error. Fixed the CSS for the ToC.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Reworked the way the <link linkend="persistent-toc">persistent ToC</link>
is generated.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Added support for ISO 690 bibliographies via a
<parameter>bibliography-style</parameter> parameter.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Fixed bug where <tag>authorgroup</tag> wasn’t being processed in
<tag>biblioentry</tag>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The parameters for the <template>t:top-nav</template> and
<template>t:bottom-nav</template> templates have changed. They are now always
called, even when chunking is not being performed. The new
<code>$chunk</code> parameter indicates whether or not a chunk is being formatted.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Fixed a bug where <tag>orderedlist</tag> numeration was not handled
correctly in cross-references to list items.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Labels for formal objects may be different, but I think the previous
formatting was actually in error.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>In some contexts, for example callouts, labels are now used for the
links instead of titles.</para>
</listitem>
