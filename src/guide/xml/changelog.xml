<revnumber>2.1.0</revnumber>
<date>2023-04-07</date>
<revdescription>
<para>This is the first official release of the “2.x” versions of the
stylesheets. Version 2.1.0 introduces a number of new features and
corrects major issues with localization and media object rendering,
but is not entirely backwards compatible with the 1.x versions. The
incompatibilities should mostly effect customization layers, not
formatted documents, though the HTML output will be a little different
in most cases. For a summary of the changes, see <xref
linkend="version2"/>.</para>
